  - players

### Full protecion
* protect boars and hens from enemies and fire (for your damage tamed modifier works)
* protect structures from rain damage
* protect your ship from water damage, or any damage, your choice
* protect your plants from any damage (to harvest barley and flax just switch off the ward)
* protect your fireplaces from stepping on them
* protect yourself from the raids (if you are sitting next to an active fire on the all kind of chair but not the floor)
* protect players from traps

### Passive repair
You can activate the ward to start passive repair process of all pieces in all connected areas.
Ward will repair one piece every 10 seconds until all pieces are healthy. Then the process will stop.

### Active offerings
Offer the certain item to ward to have some handy effect.
* surtling core to instantly repair everything
* black core to augment all structures (double the hp, ships included)
* food to start 3 min passive healing in all connected areas. Players and tamed. Better food means better heal. Helpful if you are being raided
* mead to share the effect to all players in connected areas. 
* thunderstone to call the Thor's wrath upon your enemies
* trophy to instantly kill all enemies of that speccy

Everything mentioned above works only inside of an active ward range. Yes you can change the range, disable the flash and always see the marker.
And yes the configuration is locked if you're playing on the server.

## Compatibility
* The mod should be compatible with anything I know as its patches designed to be noninvasive. But other mods may break the mod's functionality.
