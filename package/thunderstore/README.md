# Protective Wards
Configurable protection in active ward area. Creatures, rain, raids, plants, fall damage. Protect what you values.

# Description
 - Need to protect your base from various dangers?
 - Want to peacefully sit in front of a fire without being interrupted by raids?
 - Tired of your ships being constantly damaged in docks?
 - Worry about weather damage?
 - Lost all your skills to fall damage while constructing?
 - Don't like your pets being killed by raids?
 - Want to feel more confident while you are within the walls of your fortress?
